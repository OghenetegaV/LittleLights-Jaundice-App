LittleLights - Neonatal Jaundice Detection App

Project Overview:
Welcome to the GitHub repository for LittleLights, our entry for the UI Design Studio Design Competition '25!

LittleLights is an innovative mobile application concept designed to provide accessible and early screening for neonatal jaundice, particularly in low-resource settings. By leveraging smartphone camera technology, the app aims to empower parents and community health workers to monitor newborns for signs of jaundice, facilitating timely medical intervention and ultimately contributing to healthier outcomes for infants.

Our project focuses on creating a user-friendly and impactful solution that aligns with the competition's theme of "Innovative Healthcare Solutions," with a special emphasis on neonatal and maternal healthcare technology.
